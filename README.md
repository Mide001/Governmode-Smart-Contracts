# GovernMode

GovernMode is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Mode blockchain. It aims to empower its community members to participate in governance decisions related to the protocol and ecosystem development. GovernMode will be open-sourced, fostering transparency and community collaboration.

## Features

- **Decentralized Governance:** Community members can create and vote on proposals to shape the direction of GovernMode.
- **Transparent Decision-making:** All proposals and voting outcomes are publicly recorded on the blockchain for transparency.
- **Permissionless Participation:** Anyone can become a member of GovernMode and participate in governance activities.
